# The New Internet

## Old Internet  
- A mash-up of websites where people uploaded content and marketed it.  
- Google indexed everything, and users found it via search, ads, or other marketing.  
- **Hosting** was decentralized, but **consumption & information flow** were centralized.  
  - Google “owned” the browser, SEO, and the search engine.

## LLM-Powered Web  
- LLMs trained on your personal data are more powerful than any ad-targeting or personalization engine.  
- New protocols will allow LLMs to index pages with **semantic** information—shifting how we discover and consume content.

### Key Shifts  
1. **Direct Indexing**  
   - Companies with their own LLMs index information directly (no more relying on Google’s crawler).  
2. **Vertical Stack Ownership**  
   - These companies will build or acquire the full stack:
     - Browsers  
     - Product-ingestion pipelines  
     - Sitemap protocols that are LLM-parseable  
3. **Unified, Domain-Agnostic UIs**  
   - Users no longer need to remember countless `.com` domains.  
   - Instead, they pick a purpose:
     - “1 cab-booking UI”  
     - “1 food-ordering UI”  
     - “1 e-commerce UI”  
   - Exponentially better experience because LLMs can interface seamlessly across services.

> **Result:** An extra layer of abstraction. Companies that own LLMs become the new monopolies—no complex planning or reasoning needed, just solid UI + text understanding.

## Disruption & Ecosystem Moves  
- **Google** already “owns everything,” but is hampered by bureaucracy and lack of vision.  
- **OpenAI** is poaching major Chrome figures (e.g., Ben Drooger, Darin Fisher—both former VPs of Chrome).  
  - We should watch their vision for the internet’s future.  
- Industries ripe for disruption:
  - **Ads** (as users consume information, entertainment, and services differently)

## Integration with Systems  
- **Previous:** “Function calling” to give LLMs tool access.  
- **Now:** LLMs **learn** to use human tools via standard computer interfaces.  
  - Example: [LLMs using desktop tools demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vH2f7cjXjKI)

## Information Flow Protocols  
- **Previous:** RAG + ad-hoc pipelines.  
- **Now:** **Context protocols** that feed information directly into models.  
  - The LLM already knows the protocol and can even generate the integration code.  
  - Example: Claude’s Model Context Protocol by Anthropic
