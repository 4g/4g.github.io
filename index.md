## CV

- [Indri: UltraFast and realistic TTS model](2024_indri_tts.md)  
**Lead** @ **Indrivoice** [2024]  
  Built and open sourced a 124 M-parameter gpt2 based TTS/ASR treating audio as discrete tokens, supporting Hindi/English streaming at realtime CPU performance delivering high quality speech synthesis and recognition in a tiny footprint.


- [Fraud Detection & Liveness Verification](2022_jamtara.md)  
**ML Lead @ Fi** [2022]  
  Blocked sophisticated fraud during onboarding by extracting multi-modal video/audio signals from 8 s liveness videos and training a 1D-conv network to detect spoofing attempts. Resulted in deactivation of > 100k user accounts.


- [Rank 1 @ Kaggle UltraMNIST](2022_kaggle_ultramnist.md)  
 **Solo Competitor** [2022]  
  Solved the challenge of detecting tiny objects (few pixels wide) in large (2560×2560) images by combining a detector with classifier and training on synthetic data achieving 99.109 % accuracy and 1st place on the leaderboard.


- [Pose Estimation on the Edge](2020_pose.md)  
**ML Lead @ cult.fit** [2020]  
  Deployed an on-device TensorFlow Lite pose-estimation pipeline for real-time workout feedback enabling rep counting, form scoring, and gamified UI without server round-trips. Built 1MB models to do accurate pose detection on complex poses.


- [Automated Food Recognition](2018_food_tracking.md)  
**ML Lead @ HealthifyMe** [2018]  
  Solved high dropout from manual food logging by launching a snap-and-log system in two weeks curating an initial dataset, training a lightweight CNN, and automating meal tracking for diverse Indian dishes.


- [Ecommerce Search](2015_search.md)  
**Staff Engineer @ BloomReach** [2013]  
  Automated synonym extraction at scale by mining 100 M+ product descriptions and 30 M+ queries—combining contextual embeddings and supervised filtering to improve e-commerce search relevance. Granted two patents for the algorithms developed during this work.


- [EyeMouse: Gaze-Based Cursor Control](2011_ibm.md)  
**Co founder @ CHI Labs** [2011]  
  Started a company to build hands free computer control devices. Enabled hands-free cursor control via real-time gaze tracking by modeling head and eye geometry—achieving sub-100 ms latency on modest CPU hardware without heavy CV libraries. Our team won IBM Innovation webcontest 2011 for innovations in computer vision.
